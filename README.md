# Spotify Search Application

The Spotify Search Application provides users a tool to search any available song on Spotify and learn the hidden information about each song. This tool also allows users to create accounts, and save songs to their profile. The Spotify Search Application was build for Northeastern's CS5610 Web Development Final Project. The final project can be viewed here. [Click Here!](https://spotify-search-final.netlify.app/)
